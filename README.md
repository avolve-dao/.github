# Avolve DAO Repositories

Welcome to the Avolve DAO GitHub organization! Our mission is to empower individuals, collectives, and ecosystems to achieve transformation and co-create a regenerative future through the Avolve platform.

## Main Repository: [avolve.io](https://github.com/avolve-dao/avolve.io)

- **Production-ready Next.js app**
- **Supabase integration for authentication, data, and RBAC**
- **Delightful onboarding and user engagement features**
- **Admin and analytics dashboards**
- **Secure, scalable, and optimized for the first 100â€“1000 users and beyond**

## Discovery & Value Exploration Repositories

These repositories support the discovery and articulation of the core value pillars within the Avolve ecosystem. Each one is dedicated to a unique journey of transformation:

- [superachiever](https://github.com/avolve-dao/superachiever): For the individual journey of transformation, helping users create their personal and business success puzzles.
- [superachievers](https://github.com/avolve-dao/superachievers): For the collective journey, enabling groups to co-create superpuzzles and advance together.
- [supercivilization](https://github.com/avolve-dao/supercivilization): For the ecosystem journey, focusing on the evolution from degen to regen and building a supercivilization.

These repositories serve as collaborative spaces for research, content, and discovery related to the values, playbooks, and quests available within the Avolve platform.
